# Credit Risk Prediction

Credit Risk Analysis is a important aspect of banking system. And it's a perfect scenario for machine learning algorithm because of the high demand and the huge impact in most of the cases, making it a process very critical and relevant.
In this project, I used some machine learning models to automate a eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail obtained during loan application and compared the results in the final, showing the best approach for this case, based on the data I had.

## Learning Algorithm

The target value of this dataset is binary, making the classification models the recommended approach in this case.
The machine learning algorithm used here was

- <b>Logistic Regression</b>  
  
  A very common approach for binary classification, and due to it simple and quick nature, itâ€™s a good option to begin the experiment.  
  
  
- <b>Decision Tree</b>  
  
  Also a very popular model for classification, but it handle complex and non-linear relationship much better, also some other particular cases as outliers and dirty on data.  
  
  
- <b>Random Forest</b>

  It's very similar to the decision tree model, but more slow and complex. We can simply see this as a collection of decision trees whose results are aggregated into one final result.
  
  
- <b>SVM</b>
  
  The final algorithm was choosed because it's known to perform well with high dimension and less samples dataset. It's works relatively well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes
