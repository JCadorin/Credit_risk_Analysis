# Credit Risk Prediction

Credit Risk Analysis is a important aspect of banking system. And it's a perfect scenario for machine learning algorithm because of the high demand and the huge impact in most of the cases, making it a process very critical and relevant.
In this project, I used some machine learning models to automate a eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail obtained during loan application and compared the results in the final, showing the best approach for this case, based on the data I had.
